			Coinciding with the opening of Bruce Nauman’s (MFA ’66, UC
			Davis) retrospective at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, this
			exhibition features the first realization of a participatory environment
			Nauman conceived in 1970. The work is a narrow passageway that
		wraps around <span id = "mobile">an existing room, combining colored fluorescent light				and closed-circuit video to manipulate the viewer’s perceptual experience. 
		An adjacent gallery includes artworks that situate the corridor within the
		artist’s career.

		Few living artists have done as much to expand the boundaries of art since 1960
		as Bruce Nauman. During the mid-late 1960s - beginning with his time as a gradu-
		ate student in the UC Davis studio art program, where he received his MA in 1966 -
		Nauman was at the forefront of a generation of artists that placed process and ac-
		tivity over static, predetermined forms, and that took up language and the body as
		materials. Unbound by traditional divisions of medium, Nauman has moved freely
		between sculpture, performance, film, video, photography, drawing, printmaking,
		and large-scale installation.

		This exhibition coincides with a major Nauman retrospective, co-organized by The
		Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and the Schaulager Basel, the artist's first in over
		twenty years. While the retrospective provides an opportunity to survey the full
		breadth of Nauman's work, the present exhibition at the Manetti Shrem Museum
		focuses on a single, exceptional artwork: a large-scale participatory environment
		from 1970-71. Between 1969 and 1976, Nauman designed some forty corridors,
		rooms, and other architectural installations. The majority of these installations have
		been built for exhibition on at least one occasion, but Blue and Yellow Corridor is
		one of a handful that have remained on paper, in the form of drawings by the artist.
		Although Nauman originally developed the concept for this particular work in three
		drawings of 1970-1971, this exhibition represents the first time that the installation
		has actually been realized.
